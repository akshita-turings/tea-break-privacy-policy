    <h2>Zero tolerance for Child Sexual Abuse & Exploitation (CSAE)</h2>

    <p>

      TURINGS XYZ PRIVATE LIMITED and the Tea Break team have a <strong>zero-tolerance</strong> policy for any content,

      activity or behaviour that promotes, depicts, distributes, or facilitates Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE),

      including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). All reports of CSAE or possible CSAM are taken seriously and handled

      according to law and best practice.

    </p>

    <p class="muted">

      (This statement is published to comply with the Google Play Child Safety Standards requirement that

      publicly-available standards explicitly prohibit CSAE.)

    </p>

  </section>

  <section>

    <h2>What we prohibit</h2>

    <dl>

      <dt>CSAE / CSAM</dt>

      <dd>Any content that depicts, sexualizes, exploits, or endangers minors — including text messages, stickers, GIFs, links, audio recordings, or any other form of content — is strictly forbidden.</dd>

      <dt>Sexual contact with minors</dt>

      <dd>Any facilitation, arrangement, or encouragement of sexual contact with minors (including grooming) is strictly prohibited.</dd>

      <dt>Distribution or sharing of exploitative materials</dt>

      <dd>Sharing, linking to, or encouraging distribution of exploitative materials or illegal contact is prohibited and will result in immediate action (suspension, removal, and law-enforcement notification where required).</dd>

    </dl>

  </section>

  <section>

    <h2>How we detect and respond</h2>

    <p>We combine automated detection, moderator review, and user reports to identify and remove CSAE/CSAM quickly. Our response includes:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Immediate removal of violating content.</li>

      <li>Account suspension or termination for users who share or promote CSAE/CSAM.</li>

      <li>Preservation of evidence and notification to law enforcement when required by law.</li>

      <li>Cooperation with relevant authorities and compliance with applicable child-safety laws and obligations in jurisdictions where we operate.</li>

    </ul>

  </section>

  <section>

    <h2>In-app reporting and user feedback</h2>

    <p>

      Users can report suspected CSAE, CSAM, grooming, or any child-endangering behaviour via the in-app report mechanism:

      <strong>In the Tea Break app, navigate to a user's profile → Tap the "Report" button → Enter your reason for reporting → Tap "Send"</strong>.

      Reports are routed to our moderation team and reviewed 24/7 where possible.

    </p>

    <p>

      For immediate safety concerns, users can also use the SOS/Safety feature available in audio rooms to report feeling unsafe.

    </p>

    <p class="muted">

      Google requires an in-app feedback/report mechanism for apps in scope — ensure your app actually exposes a working report flow.

    </p>

  </section>

    <h2>Child safety point of contact</h2>

  </section>

  <section>

    <h2>Moderation, training, & escalation</h2>

    <p>
